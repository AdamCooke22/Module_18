# MODULE 18 CHALLENGE : PyChain

For this challenge we are working as a fintech engineer at one of the largest banks in the world. We are tasked with building a  blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface.

In this challenge we will create a record data class, modify the already existing block data class to store the record data, add functional user input availability to the streamlit interface, and test the ledger by successfully storing records.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [datetime](https://github.com/google/pandas) - This module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - This program allows for the creation of web apps from python code.

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Pandas is a powerfull tool for data analysis and manipulation. Pandas provides a plethora of useful functions that make it easy to express, analyze, and manipulate data.

* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) -This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```
import streamlit as st
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, List
import datetime as datetime
import pandas as pd
